# Major Project Reflections

## what advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
- Commit to a project you actually want to do earlier
- I tried to learn three.js at first, but I found it really hard do motivate myself and I ended up wasting about a month doing nothing

## did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
- Yeah more or less
- I would have liked to make some aspects more polished, but I have satisfied everything that I told myself I had to do.

## What was the hardest part of the project?
- Outside of commiting to a project, I would say that there were a lot of challenging parts to my project
- Implementing 3D collisions was pretty challenging, but it was really rewarding when I figured it out
- Drawing 3D images onto a 2D canvas was really buggy and had a lot of bugs that I figured out
- Synchronizing game states and displaying animations to all players took a really long time too
- Above all though, I feel that

## Were there any problems you could not solve?
- p5.party still probably has a bunch of edge cases due to multiple clients that I either haven't encountered or are too rare for me to replicate consistently and fix
- p5.js WEBGL rendering mode only enables up to 5 spotlights. Since each player uses a spotlight, this means that only max 5 people can be connected at once
- A polling rate above 125hz makes the the camera movement really inconsistent. I recall another game I played once called krunker.io experincing this issue too, and they haven't been able to find a fix.
