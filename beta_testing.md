# Major Project Feedback

## Kayaan Tharani
- Well designed and interesting game
- I would make the commands pop up or some kind of instrcutions for how the game runs
- Kind of confusing right now
- Also add a way for you to escape the chat box instead of having to press enter again

## Mohamed Younis
- I really like the space and star background you made in the sky
- The features are really cool
- Jumping feels very smooth and responsive
- Animation cutscenes are nice and well polished
- Maybe add some icons on the screen to see what you are holding
