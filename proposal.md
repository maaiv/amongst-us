# Major Project Proposal

## Project Description

For my final sds project, I will be attempting to remake the game, Among Us, but 3D and operating in a web-based environment. I will be using p5.js, most notably for it's WEBGL canvases. This project will include online multiplayer through p5.party. Ideally, I will have fully optimized 3d collisions and interactions between players, as well as working game phases. 
## Need to have list
- 3D Collisions
- Player interactivity (imposter killing crewmates, crewmates reporting bodies)
- Game phases (lobby, gamephase, discussion, win/lose)
- Dynamic User Interface
- Working map

## Nice to have list
- Menu with adjustable settings
- Proper textures
- Multiple Maps
- In-game adjustable settings/parameters
- 3D collision optimization
