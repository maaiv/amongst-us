# Major Project Proposal

## Project Description

For my final sds project, I will be attempting a remake of the game, Valorant, coded in javascript. I will be using Three.js. If I have time, I might try to incorportae online multiplayer across multiple devices as well through node.js. I will be including agent abilities as well as trying to add in most guns. This will primarily serve as a demo or a proof of concept, but depending on how far I get, I might consider expanding and adding more gamemodes

## Need to have list
- Credit System

- Shooting range environment
- Bots to shoot at
- Agent Abilities (probably just for a single agent)
- Deathmatch gamemode
- Collision system

## Nice to have list
- Actual 5v5 standard gamemode
- Imported game models (including map and player)
- Other various gamemode
- Online multiplayer
